# Purpose
Teaching Hebrew-speaking kids Python.  Teaching is based on frontal mentoring by an adult with Python knowledge based on lists of specific topics needed, and methods that need to be implemented by the student to practice and prove knowledge, with preexisting unit tests to test proper implementation.  The practice by the student is independent on a computer with necessary prerequisites, although some help by the mentor is expected.

# Prerequisites - child
- Ability to write and read English letters
- No need for large English vocabulary 
- No need for previous coding experience

# Prerequisites - mentor
- Python knowledge to explain the concepts and help the kids solve the tests.

# Setup - download software, prerequisites 
Follow [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for setup prerequisites on the computer

# File structure
- The training is split into independent Lessons that should be done in the given order
- Each Lesson contains:
  - lessonXXX.py - contains both the fuction prototypes of functions that need to be implemented, and the tests that test the fuctions.  
  - lessonXXX_with_solutions.py - same, but with solutions for reference / comparison.  Should be deleted before giving the machine to the student
  - lessonXXX.md - explanation of topics covered, prerequisites.  Should be used as a source for the mentor for frontal lesson.
  - \_playground files - files used to actually mentor the material to my kids, can be mostly disregarded
