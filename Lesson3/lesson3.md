# High level
Understanding types that we have learned so far, `bool`, `int` and `str`. 

# Topics
- Types

## Types
- Differences in use and purpose of boolean, string and integer that we have learned
- In Python, can override one type with another
- In Python, can't do operations between most different types before conversion
- `type()`
- `str()`
- `int()`
- `eval()` - currently just for translating `"False"`-->`False`, `"True"`-->`True`
- There are a lot more types besides int, str, bool that we'll learn later
